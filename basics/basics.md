# Basics

**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is not a programming language.

It is a **markup language**, used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit.

**HTML elements** form the building blocks of HTML pages, such as:
  * Headings
  * Paragraphs
  * Images
  * Lists
  * Links
  * Quotes
  * Audio and video content
and other.

HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.

```html
<p>I'm awesome!</p>
```
