# Block vs Inline elements

There are two important categories of elements in HTML, which you should know about: **block level** elements and **inline** elements.


## Block level elements

**Block level** elements form a visible block on a page. They will appear on a new line from whatever content went before it, and any content that goes after it will also appear on a new line.

Block level elements tend to be structural elements on the page that represent e.g. paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, footers, etc.

A block level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block level element.


## Inline elements

Inline elements are those that are contained within block level elements and surround only small parts of the document's content, not entire paragraphs and groupings of content.

An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document: they would normally appear inside a paragraph of text, for example an `<a>` element (hyperlink) or emphasis elements such as `<em>` or `<strong>`.
