# Special Characters

In HTML, the characters `<`, `>`,`"`,`'` and `&` are special characters. They are parts of the HTML syntax itself, so how do you include one of these characters in your text, for example if you really want to use an ampersand or less than sign, and not have it interpreted as code as some browsers may do?

We have to use character references â€” special codes that represent characters, and can be used in these exact circumstances. Each character reference is started with an ampersand (`&`), and ended by a semi-colon (`;`) ends it.


| Literal character | Character reference equivalent |
|---|---|
|<|`&lt;`|
|>|`&gt;`|
|"|`&quot;`|
|'|`&apos;`|
|&|`&amp;`|
