# Void Elements

Not all elements follow the above pattern of opening tag, content, closing tag. Some elements consist only of a single tag, which is usually used to insert/embed something in the document at the place it is included.

For example, the `<img>` element inserts an image onto a page in the position it is included in:

```html
<img src="sample_image.png">
```
