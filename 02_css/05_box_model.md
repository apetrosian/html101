# Box Model

In a document, each element is represented as a rectangular box. Determining the size, properties — like its color, background, borders aspect — and the position of these boxes is the goal of the rendering engine.

In CSS, each of these rectangular boxes is described using the standard box model. This model describes the content of the space taken by an element. Each box has four edges: the **margin edge**, **border edge**, **padding edge**, and **content edge**.

## Content

The **content** is the area containing the real content of the element. It often has a background, a color or an image and is located inside the content edge; its dimensions are the *content width*, or content-box width, and the *content height*, or content-box height.

If the CSS **box-sizing** property is set to default, the CSS properties **width**, **min-width**, **max-width**, **height**, **min-height** and **max-height** control the content size.

## Padding

The **padding** area extends to the border surrounding the padding. When the content area has a background, color, or image set on it, this will extend into the padding, which is why you can think of the padding as extending the content. The padding is located inside the *padding edge*, and its dimensions are the *padding-box width* and the *padding-box height*.

The space between the padding and the content edge can be controlled using the **padding-top**, **padding-right**, **padding-bottom**, **padding-left** and the shorthand **padding** CSS properties.

## Border

The **border** area extends the padding area to the area containing the borders. It is the area inside the *border edge*, and its dimensions are the *border-box width* and the *border-box height*.

This area depends on the size of the border that is defined by the **border-width** property or the shorthand **border**.

## Margin

The **margin** area extends the border area with an empty area used to separate the element from its neighbors. It is the area inside the *margin edge*, and its dimensions are the *margin-box width* and the *margin-box height*.

The size of the margin area is controlled using the **margin-top**, **margin-right**, **margin-bottom**, **margin-left** and the shorthand **margin** CSS properties.

When [margin collapsing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing) happens, the margin area is not clearly defined since margins are shared between boxes.

Finally, note that, for non-replaced inline elements, the amount of space taken up (the contribution to the height of the line) is determined by the **line-height** property, even though the border and padding appear visually around the content.
